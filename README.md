# data-combiner

Takes data that I already own in JSON format, deserializes it into a hashmap, parses additional data that is contained in a csv format,
matches data from the existing data agaisnt the additional data and extracts some useful additional data and combines it into one csv data format.

This is made for my upcoming lookup site which I'm making right now. Csv makes it easy to work with (spreadsheet, database import etc.)
